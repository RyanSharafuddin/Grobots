Keeps track of which other sides are hostile.
A cell's side is considered hostile if either:
1) it looks like it's going to get too close
2) we see it shortly after one of our cells was hurt

#color 9cf

Protocol:
Address 100 holds last time someone was hit.
Addresses that are side IDs hold true if the side is hostile.
(Actually they hold the time the side was declared hostile.)
