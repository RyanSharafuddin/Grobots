#side Unproductive 2

Inspired by Productive, of course. Also influenced by MicroAlgae
and several unfinished sides of mine.

Productive's corner-hiding is very effective, but it often runs
into enemies and dies on the way. Unproductive's factories hide
next to walls only when the wall is close enough that there won't
be anyone in the way. They also run from shots, enemies, and
injuries (like MicroAlgae).

I made several attempts at sides that stay away from enemies,
mostly using long-range robot-sensors, which were too expensive.
I started one that ran away from spotters' reports, but didn't
finish it until MicroAlgae demonstrated it could be effective.

The factories need someone to watch for enemies, so I used
fighter/gatherers. These two functions haven't often been combined
in one type, but it works surprisingly well. The fighters are
well-fed, and the gatherers aren't helpless. The downside is that
every lost battle cripples the economy. The cost pressure of
having combat + eating + syphon in one type is also annoying.

The medium-short range blaster has most of the advantages of very
short range: it's cheap,  it's hard to miss with, and longer-range
enemies tend to run away while trying to keep their distance. It
can hit medium-range opponents, and can kill Commune's Revenge from a
safe distance. Because the fighters rigidly control their range,
friendly fire is only a minor problem.

I first tried these short-range fighter/gatherers in another side,
which even in an unfinished state could stand up to the Top Nine.
Then I completely broke it in an attempt to add active dodging. :(
I've recreated its fighter/gatherers here (with syphons, since
there's no one else to syphon from them).


To do:
	Food-sharing. Maybe coupled to keeping screen spread out.
	Remember hostile sides, so we don't ignore incoming Revenges etc.
	Fighters are too aggressive early, and tend to run off and get
	  killed. This accounts for the bad early score. They should be
	  more skittish (also when hurt). They should also be less
	  agressive when far from their factories.
	Fighters sometimes ignore an ongoing fight when it's moved.
	Repair fighters.
	Better fleeing in corners.
	Factories could get more shy with increasing population.

(20060604) Bugfix: when starting near the center, factories went to the wall.
           Reduced engine power when wandering.
(20060606) Now flees from shot-position, not estimated shot origin.
           Improved top comments.
           Now flees no farther than necessary.
(20060616) Not so willing to go to the center.
