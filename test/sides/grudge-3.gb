Keeps track of which other sides are hostile.
A cell's side is considered hostile if it has a bomb or is reloading.

Protocol:
Address 100 holds last time someone was hit.
Addresses that are side IDs hold true if the side is hostile.
(Actually they hold the time the side was declared hostile.)

(20021120) Slightly shorter range and more growth.
(20021120) Reduced angry time after being hurt.
(20040811) Use robot-bomb. Ignore nearby or approaching targets.
(20040813) Use robot-reloading. Some reorganization.
