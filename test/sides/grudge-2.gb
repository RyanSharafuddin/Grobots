Keeps track of which other sides are hostile.
A cell's side is considered hostile if either:
1) it looks like it's going to get too close
2) we see it shortly after one of our cells was hurt

#color 9cf

Protocol:
Address 100 holds last time someone was hit.
Addresses that are side IDs hold true if the side is hostile.
(Actually they hold the time the side was declared hostile.)

(20021120) Slightly shorter range and more growth.
(20021120) Reduced angry time after being hurt.
